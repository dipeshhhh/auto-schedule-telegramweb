## Overview
### Problem
Manually entering messages and times for scheduling a bulk of similar messages daily is a boring and time-consuming task.

### Solution
This project provides a bookmarklet for quickly automating the bulk scheduling of messages on Telegram Web.
- You can now create a JSON dataset for your messages and timings in the following format:
#### JSON file example.
```json
[
  {"hh":"01", "mm":"00", "msg":"Good Morning, it is currently 1:00AM üïê"},
  {"hh":"12", "mm":"00", "msg":"Good Afternoon, it is currently 12:00PM üïõ"},
  {"hh":"17", "mm":"00", "msg":"Good Evening, it is currently 5:00PM üïî"},
  {"hh":"22", "mm":"00", "msg":"Good Night, it is currently 10:00PM üïô"}
]
```
```js
//... Add more accordingly
```
- Then use this dataset in the Auto Schedule Telegram bookmarklet. Follow the steps for [Installation](#installation) and [Execution](#execution).

## Features
